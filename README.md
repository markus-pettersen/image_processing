# Image Processing Project
This project uses supervised machine learning on the well-known MNIST handwritten digit database. From Sci-kit learn, a random forest model is used to
predict the digit depicted in an image.

## Installation
The project is written in Python as a Jupyter Notebook, and requires the following modules:

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Pyplot from Matplotlib
* Sci-kit learn

## Usage
The Jupyter Notebook has both code cells and markdown cells. Each markdown cells describes what the next cells are doing and why.

## Credits
The MNIST database in csv format was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv). The original source and author of the dataset are found [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
